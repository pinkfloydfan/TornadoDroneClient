# Simple Python Tornado client for interfacing with ESP32

The ESP32 hosts a websocket server. Its IP address is hardcoded into this program, and it can then communicate over the websocket.

# To run

- Rust compiler needed to build roslibpy
- Install Tornado (venv preferred): `python3 -m pip install tornado`
- Install Roslibpy: `pip install roslibpy`
